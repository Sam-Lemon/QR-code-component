## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project strengthened my skills of aligning items in the center of the screen. 
I eventually landed on the below code, and got the card to sit in the middle.

```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0px;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to do some more practice projects like this that make me think 
outside of what my classes have taught me and strengthen my skill set.
